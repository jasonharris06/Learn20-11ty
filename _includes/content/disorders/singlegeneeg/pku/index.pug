         | People with PKU cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe). Like all amino acids, Phe comes from protein in food. It is released into the blood stream during digestion. Our cells can recycle Phe by adding it to new proteins, break it down for energy, or turn it into other molecules the body needs. When it is not used, Phe can build up to levels that are harmful to the brain.

         | The most commonly affected gene in PKU is PAH (phenylalanine hydroxylase). The gene codes for the PAH protein. People with PKU have two non-working copies of the PAH gene. Either the protein is missing altogether, or it is less able to do its job. 
      p
         | PAH protein is active in the liver, where it begins the process of breaking down Phe. Without this protein, Phe levels in the blood can become too high.
      p
         | PKU follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. An affected child must inherit two non-working copies of the gene, one from each parent.

         p People with PKU are lacking a protein that processes the amino phenylalanine (Phe). They need to eat a diet low in Phe. Because they cannot convert Phe into the amino acid tyrosine (Tyr), they must also take a Tyr supplement.

      h3 Symptoms and features of PKU
      p
         | PKU can look very different between individual people, depending on the specific gene variants they have. The "classic" form is the most common, and also the most dangerous. 
      p
         | Babies who have PKU are usually healthy at first, but symptoms appear within a few months. These may include slow growth, eczema (a skin rash), musty body odor (from too much Phe), small head size, and fair skin (because Phe is converted into skin pigment). Without treatment, children with PKU experience developmental delays, behavior problems, intellectual disability, and seizures. 
      p
         | Because early intervention can prevent the most serious symptoms, PKU is included in most newborn genetic screening panels. With early intervention, many people with PKU have no health effects from their condition.

      h3 Treating and managing PKU
      p
         | PKU is managed mainly with diet, though some people do receive medication to help lower their Phe levels. People who have PKU must eat a very low-protein diet, because nearly all proteins contain Phe. Babies are given a special Phe-free formula. Children must avoid protein-rich foods such as meat, eggs, cheese, and nuts. They must also avoid artificial sweeteners with aspertame, which contains Phe. Adults can usually follow a diet that is less strict.
      p
         | People with PKU also take a supplement that supplies essential amino acids, including tyrosine (Tyr). These are protein building blocks that the body cannot make on its own and must be gotten through diet.
