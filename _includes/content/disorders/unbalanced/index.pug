        | Some cases of <b>Down syndrome</b> arise in the children of parents who carry a Robertsonian translocation that involves chromosome 21. Down syndrome can also be caused by having some duplicated information from chromosome 21, either as an insertion within chromosome 21 or a translocation involving a piece of chromosome 21. Usually the effects of a partial duplication are milder than those of having an entire extra copy of chromosome 21.

        | Some cases of <b>Turner syndrome</b> are caused by a deletion of a piece of the X chromosome. In these individuals, the effects are usually milder than if they were missing their entire X chromosome.
