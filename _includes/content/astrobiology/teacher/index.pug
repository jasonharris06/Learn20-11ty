            | Astrobiology is the study of life and the search for habitable environments beyond Earth. These activities can help you explore the question: Are we alone in the Universe? while introducing concepts in Earth and Life Science.  Companion activities on Learn.Genetics:

            | A create-an-organism activity where students identify the conditions that may support life and the conditions that may be challenging to life in the extreme environment of a fictitious planet. Students then design an organism with features (adaptations) that would allow it to live in the conditions described. Students may work individually or in groups.

            | Play a matching game with the cards, matching the card with the description of the organism&apos;s environment with the card that describes it&apos;s adaptation.
         p
            | Sort the cards by criteria generated by you or the students, such as:  type of extreme in environment, type of adaptation, domain of life , etc.

            | Ask students to choose which organisms they would use to colonize space or a specific planet or moon.

            | Integrate the cards with the Aterra4 Explorer activity, asking students to choose which organisms might survive in the environment of their given planet.
