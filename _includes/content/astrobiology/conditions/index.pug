                  | NASA&apos;s Kepler Mission is looking for habitable planets in our neighborhood of the Milky Way. Using their
               a(href='http://www.planethunters.org', target='_blank', style='letter-spacing:normal') online tool
               | , you can help
               |          NASA in their search for new planets.

      .uk-width-medium-4-10
         p
            | Even if we assume any habitable planet must be Earth-like (and it may not be), chances are
            | we&apos;re not alone. Astrobiologists estimate that the Milky Way has 500 habitable planets, which
            | fit the following criteria:

         ul
            li
               | They&apos;re a comfortable distance away from a star similar to our sun. That is, they&apos;re far enough away to be
               | out of the heavy heat and radiation zone, but not so far that they&apos;re extremely cold. This just-right distance
               | is called the &quot;habitable zone.&quot;

            li
               | They&apos;re made of rock. Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus in our solar system are made of gases, so we don&apos;t expect
               | life to be able to survive there.

            li
               | They&apos;re big enough to have a molten core. Earth&apos;s core gives us a source of geothermal energy, it allows
               | cycling of raw materials, and it sets up a magnetic field around the planet that protects us from radiation.
               | Mars probably had a hot liquid core at one time, but because it&apos;s a smaller planet its heat dissipated more
               | quickly.

            li
               | They are good candidates for having a protective atmosphere. The atmosphere holds carbon dioxide and other
               | gases that keep the planet warm and protect its surface from radiation.

   +pod('What about intelligent life?')

      .uk-width-medium-6-10
         p
            | Even today, most Earth life is microbial. And microbes have been here for at least 3.5 billion
            | yearsÂ—a very long time when you consider that the first rocks formed about 3.8 billion years ago.
            | Given the number of potentially habitable planets within our home galaxy, chances are good that
            | microbial life exists elsewhere.

         p
            | Whether more-complex life forms like plants and insects exist elsewhere is a bigger
            | question. For 2.9 billion years or so, all life on Earth was microscopic. Multicellular,
            | macroscopic algae and animals came onto the scene about 600 million years ago. That&apos;s about
            | 17% of the total time that life has existed on Earth.

         p
            | It&apos;s very hard to say how likely we are to find other intelligent life forms. The oldest
            | fossils of our species, Homo sapiens, are less than 200,000 years old. That&apos;s a geological
            | microsecond, just 0.000057% of the time microbes have been around. If, like on Earth,
            | intelligent life takes much longer to evolve than microbial life, it might be rare. But some
            | galaxies and solar systems are much older than ours, so maybe other intelligent life has formed;
            | however, it may be long dead. Finding living intelligent beings is a matter of both space and time.

         p
            | Just as conditions on Earth have changed drastically over time, so have conditions on other planets.
            | When astrobiologists evaluate a planet, they look not just at its current conditions, but for signs
            | that it could have been habitable in the past.

         p
            | Liquid water leaves behind a kind of footprint. Mars, for example, has what looks like dry
            | river and lake beds, making astrobiologists wonder if the cold, dry planet could have once been
            | covered with life. If it was, there may be enough remaining liquid water to sustain microbial
            | life deep underground or under the frozen ice caps.

         p
            | Living things change their environment, leaving behind certain physical and chemical signatures. Even
            | a planet that is lifeless today could have fossil evidence of ancient life forms. Fossils and chemical
            | remnants can tell us a lot about what extinct life might have looked like.
