            | To &quot;read&quot; a set of chromosomes, scientists use three key features to identify their similarities and differences:

               strong Size.
               |  This is the easiest way to tell chromosomes apart.

               strong Banding pattern.
               |  The size and location of Giemsa bands make each chromosome unique.

               strong Centromere position.
               |  Centromeres appear as a constriction. They have a
               |             role in the separation of chromosomes into daughter cells during cell division (mitosis and meiosis).
         p
            | Using these key features, scientists can identify all 46 chromosomes Â— one set of 23 from each parent

            | Centromeres are required for chromosome separation during cell division. The centromeres
            | are attachement points for microtubules, which are protein fibers that pull duplicate chromosomes              toward opposite ends of the cell before it divides. This separation ensures
            | that each daughter cell will have a full set of chromosomes.

         p Each chromosome has only one centromere.

            | The position of the centromere relative to the ends
            | helps scientists tell chromosomes apart. Centromere position can be described
            | three ways: metacentric, submetacentric or acrocentric.
         p
            | In 
            strong metacentric
            |  (met-uh-CEN-trick) chromosomes, the centromere lies near the center of the chromosome.
         p
            strong Submetacentric
            |  (SUB-met-uh-CEN-trick) chromosomes have a centromere that is off-center, so that one chromosome arm is longer than the other. The short arm is designated &quot;p&quot; (for               petite), and the long arm is designated &quot;q&quot; (because it follows the letter &quot;p&quot;).
         p
            | In 
            strong acrocentric
            |   (ACK-ro-CEN-trick) chromosomes, the centromere is very near one end.
