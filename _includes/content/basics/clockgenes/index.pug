            | Take the red-eye from California to New York, and you&apos;ll experience firsthand the effects of your body&apos;s internal
            | clock. If you feel drowsy or &quot;jet lagged&quot; after the flight, it&apos;s because there&apos;s been a disruption to your natural
            | circadian rhythms. Your internal clock is saying it&apos;s 3 am, but outside, it&apos;s time for breakfast.
         |       
         p
            | Living organisms evolved an internal biological clock, called the circadian rhythm, to help their bodies adapt to the
            | daily cycle of day and night (light and dark) as the Earth rotates every 24 hours. The term &quot;circadian&quot; comes from the
            | Latin words for about (circa) a day (diem).
         |       
         p
            | Circadian rhythms are controlled by &quot;clock genes&quot; that code for clock proteins. The levels
            | of these proteins rise and fall in rhythmic patterns. These oscillating biochemical signals control various functions,
            | including when we sleep and rest, and when we are awake and active. Circadian rhythms also control body temperature,
            | heart activity, hormone secretion, blood pressure, oxygen consumption, metabolism, and many other functions.
         |       
         p
            | Daily cycles also regulate the levels of substances in our blood, including red blood cells, blood sugar, gases,
            | and ions such as potassium and sodium. Our internal clocks may even influence our mood, particularly in the form
            | of wintertime depression known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD).
         |       
         p
            | A biological clock has three parts: a way to receive light, temperature, or other input from the environment; the protein and chemicals that make up the clock itself; and components that help the clock control the activity of other genes.
         |       
         p
            | In the last few decades, scientists have discovered the genes that control internal clocks: period 
            em (per)
            | , 
            |          clock 
            em (clk)

            | , frequency 
            em (frq)
            | , doubletime 
            em (dbt)
            |  and others. Clock genes have been found in organisms ranging from people to mice, fish, fruit flies, plants, molds, and even single-celled cyanobacteria.

            | The master circadian clock that regulates 24-hour cycles throughout our bodies is found in a region called the
            | suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the hypothalamus of the brain. The SCN is made up of two tiny clusters of several
            | thousand nerve cells that &quot;tell time&quot; based on external cues, such as light and darkness. The SCN regulates sleep,
            | metabolism, and hormone production.
         |       
         p
            | How important is the SCN? When a rat&apos;s SCN is removed, its daily cycle of activity and sleep is disrupted. The SCN
            | still produces rhythmic chemical signals, even outside of an animal&apos;s brain.
         |       
         p
            | The SCN is believed to synchronize &quot;local&quot; clocks that sit in organs and tissues throughout the body, either through hormones
            | or changes in body temperature. Local gene-operated clocks independent of the brain&apos;s master pacemaker have been found in
            | the liver, lung, testis, connective tissue, and muscle.
         |       
         p
            | One example of a local clock comes from fruit flies. Cells in their antennae display a circadian rhythm
            | independent of the brain&apos;s master clock. The antennae oscillations correlate with sense of smell, which is more
            | sensitive at night than during the day.

            | The human circadian rhythm is not exactly 24 hours Â— it&apos;s actually 10 to 20 minutes longer. Other species have
            | circadian rhythms ranging from 22 to 28 hours. Biological clocks keep working even when
            | organisms are removed from natural light. Without daylight, the biological clock will continue running
            | on its own natural cycle. But as soon as morning light hits the eyes, the clock will reset to match the earth&apos;s
            | 24-hour day.
         |       
         p
            | Why aren&apos;t organisms&apos; internal clocks exactly 24 hours long? A computer simulation suggests competition for
            | food and other resources is most intense among species with 24-hour cycles. If you eat at the same time as everyone
            | else, you&apos;re less likely to get your share. Our slightly out-of-sync internal clock may have evolved to help us
            | survive the competition.

         p
            | Biological clocks also play a role in longer cycles such as hibernation, migrations, and even annual changes
            | in coat and color. When the animal brain records longer days in the spring and shorter days in
            | the fall, it triggers hormone secretion that influences these events.

         p
            | Clock genes are sets of instructions that code for clock proteins. The genes and proteins interact with each other to 
            | produce daily fluctuations in protein levels. The central player is the 
            em per
            |  gene, which codes for
            |            PER protein. PER levels are highest during early evening and lowest early in the day.
         |

            | In fruit flies, the 
            em clk
            |  and

            |  genes 
            |          so they produce proteins. Those proteins, PER and TIM, then combine and slowly accumulate in the cell nucleus, where 
            |          they slow down the

            |  and 
            em tim
            |  and stops 
            |          further production of the PER and TIM proteins. As PER and TIM diminish,

         |       
         p
            | The cycle is a bit more complicated in mammals, in which 
            em clk

            | In 2001, scientists at the University of Utah discovered the first human clock gene. They found it while studying a
            | rare inherited disorder that makes people fall asleep early and wake spontaneously hours before dawn. Clock genes
            | normally keep us awake during the day and asleep at night. But this clock gene is altered in a way that disrupts the normal sleep cycle.
         |       
         p
            | This inherited sleep pattern, known as &quot;familial advanced sleep phase syndrome&quot; (FASPS), has been linked to a variation in the 
            em hPer2
            |  gene. People with FASPs are &quot;morning larks&quot; who usually get sleepy by 7 pm and wake up around 2 am. Another sleep condition,  called &quot;delayed sleep-phase syndrome,&quot; has the opposite effect, turning people who have it into extreme night owls. They 
            |          fall asleep very late and have trouble waking up in the morning. Delayed sleep-phase syndrome has been linked to a variation in the

         p
            | Any student who has studied during an &quot;all-nighter&quot; knows the circadian clock isn&apos;t the only sleep influencer. Our need for sleep
            | also plays a role. When rats are awake and vigilant, their brain&apos;s master clock is more active. When rats are deprived of sleep,
            | their master-clock doesn&apos;t respond normally.

            | Sunlight resets the internal biological clock every day, keeping it synchronized with a 24-hour day. If you lived in an
            | underground bunker under constant artificial light, you would continue to follow an approximately 24-hour sleep-wake
            | pattern, but because it is not exactly 24 hours long, your cycle would slowly get out of phase with actual daytime and nighttime.
         |       
         p
            | Air travel to a distant time zone can also disrupt normal cycles. The resulting jet lag is both a disconnect between local
            | time and your body&apos;s time, and a disconnect between your brain&apos;s master clock and local clocks in tissues throughout your
            | body. Once you arrive at your destination, the change in daylight hours will &quot;entrain&quot; or reset your internal clock, but
            | it will take a few days to get rid of the jet lag.
