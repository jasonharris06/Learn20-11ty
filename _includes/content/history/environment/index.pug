            | Even if your family medical history puts you at high risk
            | for developing a disease, the environment you live in and the choices you make
            | will largely determine your fate. With healthy living, you can reduce if not

            | Several key environmental factors can affect your risk for
            | developing disease. The leading preventable cause of death in the United States
            | is smoking, closely followed by obesity. Avoiding tobacco and maintaining a
            | healthy body weight will greatly reduce your risk of developing diseases such
            | as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes.

            | The body uses three dietary fuels: carbohydrates, proteins,
            | and fats. Each provides energy (calories) the body needs to keep it running
            | smoothly. Most foods contain a combination of all three fuels. But compared to
            | carbs and proteins, dietary fats provide double the amount of energy.

            | It&apos;s important to eat just the right amount of calories to
            | meet your body&apos;s needs for energy. If you eat more calories than you can use, the
            | body will store the extra calories as fatÂ—regardless of whether the calories
            | come in the form of fat, carbs, or protein. If you accumulate too much stored
            | fat, you can become obese. To help maintain a healthy weight, you can choose
            | nutritious foods and be physically active.

            | Tobacco contains a chemical called nicotine that is very
            | addicting. Once you start smoking or chewing tobacco, it&apos;s very difficult to
            | stop.
         |       
         p
            | Tobacco contains chemicals that can mutate the DNA in your
            | lung cells, causing them to become cancerous. In fact, smoking is the leading
            | cause of lung cancer, and it increases your risk of developing other cancers as
            | well.
         |       
         p
            | Smoking affects more than just your lungs; your heart
            | suffers too. Nicotine narrows blood vessels and decreases the amount of
            | &quot;good&quot; cholesterol in the blood, leading to high blood pressure and
            | heart disease.
         |       
         p
            | On average, adults who smoke cigarettes die 13-14 years earlier
            | than nonsmokers. Approximately 440,000 Americans die each year from diseases
            | directly related to tobacco use.
