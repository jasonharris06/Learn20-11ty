               | Slide the controls to see how the balance between water coming in and water going out influences a lake&apos;s elevation and its salinity.  Think about how changes in the water&apos;s salinity might influence the creatures that live there.

            | Like the lake above, water flowing into Great Salt Lake comes from two main sources: precipitation and inflow from rivers. River water carries small amounts of dissolved minerals, which have become concentrated over thousands of years, making the lake salty and mineral-rich.
   +pod('Water Out')
      .uk-width-medium-6-10
         p
            | Because this lake, like Great Salt Lake, sits at the bottom of a closed basin, no rivers flow out of it. The only way water can leave is through evaporation. When water evaporates, everything dissolved in it stays behind-including salt, minerals, and pollutants.
