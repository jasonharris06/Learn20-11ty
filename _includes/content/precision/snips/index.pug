            | Scientists are identifying, cataloging, and studying small genetic variations
            | among humans that will lead to more specialized and effective medical treatments. What do
            | these variations look like, and what exactly makes them informative?
         p
            | Researchers look for one or more
            | single
            | nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; pronounced &quot;snips&quot;).  SNPs are single-nucleotide
            | substitutions of one base for another that occur in more than one percent of the
            | general population.

            | The challenge for scientists is to identify SNPs that correlate with a particular effect in patients. Reliable SNPs could
            | serve as predictive markers that inform our decisions about numerous aspects of
            | medical care, including specific diseases, effectiveness of various drugs and
            | adverse reactions to specific drugs.

            | millions of patients through accurate diagnoses and matching patients with
            | appropriate medicines.

            | Scientists approach the problem of identifying, cataloging, and characterizing SNPs in two main ways:

               strong Genomic approaches
               | . This approach is used by scientists who want to see the
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;big picture. Several large-scale projects have combined the efforts
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;of many institutions to identify and catalog all
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;of the SNPs in the 3-billion-base pair human genome. Each project involves hundreds of
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;scientists, who compare the genomes of numerous individuals to identify the differences.
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;These comparisons require a lot of computer-powered data analysis. As they work, scientists
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;sort and catalog their results in databases that are available to anyone over the Internet,
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;including other scientists and you.
            li
               strong Functional approaches
               | . This approach is used by scientists who are interested
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;in a particular disease or drug response. The biological processes involved in
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;diseases and drug responses are controlled by the activities of many genes. Scientists
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;interested in a particular process select genes known to be involved in the
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;process and examine them in people who have a response or disease, as well as those
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;who don&apos;t. By comparing people&apos;s DNA sequences, scientists can identify SNPs that
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;correspond with a particular function or response.

            | SNP (pronounced &quot;snip&quot;) stands for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism. SNPs are single-nucleotide
            | substitutions of one base for another. Each SNP location in the genome can have up to four
            | versions: one for each nucleotide, A, C, G, and T. A SNP and its distribution in a population
            | might look like the images below and to the left.

         | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
         p
            | Not all single-nucleotide changes are SNPs, though. To be classified as a SNP, two or more
            | versions of a sequence must each be present in at least one percent of the general population.
         | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
         | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
         p
            | SNPs occur throughout the human genomeÂ—about one in every 300 nucleotide base
            | pairs. This translates to about 10 million SNPs within the 3-billion-nucleotide human genome.

            | If you know what a point mutation is, then the description of a SNP might
            | sound similar. True, both are single-nucleotide differences in a DNA sequence,
            | but SNPs should not be confused with disease-causing mutations.
            | The image to the left shows some tell-tale differences:

         | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
         p
            | First, to be classified as a SNP, the change must be present in at least one percent of
            | the general population. No known disease-causing mutation is this common.

         | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
         p
            | Second, most disease-causing mutations occur within a gene&apos;s coding or regulatory regions
            | and affect the function of the protein encoded by the gene. Unlike mutations, SNPs are not
            | necessarily located within genes, and they do not always affect the way a protein functions.
            | SNPs are divided into two main categories:

            p
               strong Linked SNPs
               |  (also called indicative SNPs) do not reside within genes and do not affect
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;protein function. Nevertheless, they do correspond to a particular drug response or to the
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;risk for getting a certain disease.

               strong Causative SNPs
               |  affect the way a protein functions, correlating with a
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;disease or influencing a person&apos;s response to medication. Causative SNPs come in two forms:

            div(style='padding-left: 25px;')
               p
                  strong Coding SNPs
                  | , located within the coding region of a gene, change the
                  | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;amino acid sequence of the gene&apos;s protein product.
               | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
               p
                  strong Non-coding SNPs
                  | , located within the gene&apos;s regulatory sequences,
                  | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;change the timing, location, or level of gene expression.
