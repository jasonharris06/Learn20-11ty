                     p Go beyond the Punnett square, and look at Mendel&apos;s Laws of Inheritance from a mathematical perspective.

                     p Some genes mask the effects of others. This page uses an easy-to-understand analogy to explain how.

                     p Genes located near one another on the same chromosome are often inherited together.
                  +index-item('Sex Linkage','learn more','sexlinkage','images/sexlinkage.jpg')
                     p For genes on sex chromosomes, inheritance works differently in males and females.

                     p Slipper, Grouse, and Muff describe different types of feathering on the legs and feet.

                     p Pigeons can have 4 different wing patterns: barless, bar, check, and t-check.
                  +index-item('Major Color Locus','learn more','color','images/color.jpg')
                     p Three alleles of this sex-linked gene control whether feathers are blue, brown, or ash-red.
