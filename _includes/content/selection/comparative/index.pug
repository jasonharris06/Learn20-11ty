            | Rock pocket mice live in the deserts of the American southwest. Ancestral pocket mice had light-colored coats that
            | blended in with the region&apos;s rocks and sandy soil, keeping the mice hidden from their owl predators. Starting about
            | 1.7 million years ago, a series of volcanic eruptions spewed out wide trails of black lava that wove right through the
            | middle of pocket-mouse territory.

         p
            | Today there are two forms of pocket mice: light-colored mice that live on sandy soil, and dark-colored mice that live on black lava
            | rock. The dark mice came about through the process of evolution. Naturally occurring mutations to coat-color genes
            | produced mice with dark fur. On black rocks, dark mice had an advantage over light mice: they were better-hidden from
            | predators. They survived and reproduced, passing their dark-fur genes to their offspring, which still survive today.

         p
            | Once a favorable variation occurs, it can quickly become the major form in a population. Each year, mice produce
            | more offspring than will reach adulthood. Thanks to natural selection, the offspring with favorable characteristics
            | are more likely to survive and reproduce.

Even when they convey no selective advantage or disadvantage, recessive alleles are maintained in a population.")

            | In this animation, the coat color that matches the background has just a 10% advantage over its counterpart. In
            | other words, on a dark background there are 110 surviving dark offspring for every 100 surviving light offspring. A
            | variation with a mere 10% advantage can grow from a tiny minority to 95% of the population in just a few-hundred years.
            | Researchers estimate that dark mice on a dark background actually have greater than a 10% advantage. On a mixed
            | landscape, our animation assumes that neither coat color conveys an advantage. *

         p
            | In our animation, the mouse population always contains both coat-color variations, even if one variation is present at
            | a very low frequency. So how do these variations come about in the first place, and what are the odds of a favorable mutation occurring?

               | Variations in a gene called MC1R are responsible for producing dark fur in rock pocket mice. Just one copy of the dark
               | MC1R-gene variant is enough to produce dark fur, while two copies of the light variation produce light fur. Interestingly,
               | the MC1R gene is the basis of color variations in several other species, including bears, cats, and snow geese.
