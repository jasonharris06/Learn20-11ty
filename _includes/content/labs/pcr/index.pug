            | PCR (short for Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a relatively simple and inexpensive tool that you can use
            | to focus in on a segment of DNA and copy it billions of times over. PCR is used every day to diagnose
            | diseases, identify bacteria and viruses, match criminals to crime scenes, and in many other ways. Step
            | up to the virtual lab bench and see how it works!

            strong(style='font-size:14px; color:#66ABCC;') Primers
            |  are short pieces of
            |          DNA that are made in a laboratory. Since they&apos;re custom built, primers can have any
            |          sequence of nucleotides you&apos;d like.

         p
            | In a PCR experiment, two primers are designed to match to the segment of DNA you want
            | to copy. Through complementary base pairing, one primer attaches to the top strand at
            | one end of your segment of interest, and the other primer attaches to the bottom strand
            | at the other end. In most cases, 2 primers that are 20 or so nucleotides long will target
            | just one place in the entire genome.

         p
            | Primers are also necessary because DNA polymerase can&apos;t attach at just any old place
            | and start copying away. It can only add onto an existing piece of DNA.
         p
            strong(style='font-size:14px; color:#66ABCC;') DNA Polymerase
            |  is a naturally occurring
            |          complex of proteins whose function is to copy a cell&apos;s DNA before it divides in two. When a
            |          DNA polymerase molecule bumps into a primer that&apos;s base-paired with a longer piece of DNA,
            |          it attaches itself near the end of the primer and starts adding nucleotides. (In nature,
            |          these primers are made by an enzyme called primase).

         p
            | The DNA polymerase in our bodies breaks down at temperatures well below 95 &deg;C (203 &deg;F), the
            | temperature necessary to separate two complementary strands of DNA in a test tube.
            | The DNA polymerase that&apos;s most often used in PCR comes from a strain of bacteria called
            em Thermus aquaticus
            |  that live in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park. It can survive
            |          near boiling temperatures and works quite well at 72 &deg;C (162 &deg;F).

         p
            strong(style='font-size:14px;  color:#66ABCC;') Nucleotides
            |  are the building blocks
            |          that DNA molecules are made of. You add a mixture of four types of nucleotides to your PCR
            |          reactionÂ—A&apos;s, C&apos;s, G&apos;s and T&apos;s. DNA polymerase grabs nucleotides that are floating in the
            |          liquid around it and attaches them to the end of a primer.
