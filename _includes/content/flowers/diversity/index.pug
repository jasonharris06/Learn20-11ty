                | Both flowing plants and animal pollinators are incredibly diverse. One reason for this diversity is the close 
                | relationship they have with one another. Over many years, some flowers and pollinators have influenced each 
                | other's evolution. Today, when flower-pollinator pairs have traits that work very well together, it's a sign 
                | this kind of evolution may have happened.

                | When the traits of one species evolve in response to the traits of another species, it's called co-evolution.
            p
                | Flowers and their pollinators affect one another's reproductive success. It's what makes them likely to co-evolve. The 
                | traits flowers have determine the traits that will give pollinators an advatage, and vice versa. Over many generations, 
                | favorable trait combinations become more common. Eventually, flower-pollinator pairs are very good at helping one another 
                | reproduce.

                | Co-evolution is occurring right now. But the process is too slow for us to watch. How do we know it actually happens? If two species have 
                | corresponding traits, it's a good starting point. But to truly demonstrate co-evolution, researchers need more evidence.
            p
                | As one example, long-tongued flies, 
                em Prosoeca ganglbaueri
                | , and figwort flowers, 
                em Zaluzianskya microsiphon
                | , live together in several places in South Africa. The flies are the flowers' main pollinator. They feed from the flowers' deep nectar tubes. 
                | Researchers studied the relationship of fly mouthparts and flower nectar tubes. They measured the length of each trait at distinct geographical 
                | locations. From one location to another, the mouthpart and nectar tube lengths vary. But, within a single location, the two traits are well-matched. 
                | This was evidence that flies and flowers that live together influence each other's traits.
            p
                | The researchers also showed there is an advantage to matching traits. They mixed flies and flowers from different locations. Some fly tongues were 
                | too long and they fed from flowers without pollinating them. As a result, those flowers made fewer seeds. Those plants were less likely to reproduce 
                | since the traits didn't match.

        .uk-width-medium-5-10
            p
                | Not all corresponding traits between flowers and pollinators are due to co-evolution. Pollinator shifts also have a big influence on flower traits.
            p
                | A pollinator shift is when a different pollinator becomes the main visitor to a flower species. It occurs when a new pollinator moves into the flower's 
                | neighborhood. Or if a new flower moves into the pollinator's neighborhood. It also happens when a flower species has a new trait by chance, which makes 
                | it attractive to a different type of pollinator.
            p
                | Visitation by the new pollinator causes the flower population to adapt. In the short-term, pollinator shifts are often a bit more one-sided compared to 
                | co-evolution. Traits in the flower population quickly change to ensure pollination from the new pollinator. But over a longer time, the two species will 
                | influence each other.

            p
                | Over time, both co-evolution and pollinator shifts lead to reproductive isolation. The part of the population with new traits no longer interbreeds with the original 
                | population. As more time passes, the newly-isolated population continues to change. Eventually, the original species diverges into two.
