            Four species of cotton are farmed. All of them belong to the genus <i>Gossypium</i>.

            About 90% the cotton grown in the US and around the world is upland cotton (<i>G. hirsutum</i>). The plants produce large amounts of fiber, which is used mainly for clothing like t-shirts and blue jeans, as well as disposable products and paper. Upland cotton is native to the Americas.

            Pima cotton (<i>G. barbadense</i>), also known as Egyptian cotton or extra-long staple cotton, is famous for its long, strong, and silky fibers. The plants are harder to grow than upland, and they produce smaller amounts of fiberâ€”but their fiber is very valuable. It is used for high-quality textiles, like high thread-count sheets and fine dress shirts. Pima cotton is also native to the Americas. (<i>photos by Forest &amp; Kim Star</i>)

            Tree cotton (<i>G. arboreum</i>) is native to India, and Levant cotton (<i>G. herbaceum</i>) is native to Africa. These varieties are less productive than their American relatives, and their fibers are shorter and course, so their usefulness is more limited. Together, they account for just a few percent of the world's commercially produced cotton, though they were more widely used before the modern era.
