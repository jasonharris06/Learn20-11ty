		<p>We are made mostly of water. It accounts for about 65% of our body weight and more than 90% of our blood. And water makes up the bulk of our food and drink.</p>
		<p>The breakdown products of proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids dissolve in water. They can travel easily in the watery contents of our digestive system, bloodstream, and cells. But when it comes to fats, oil and water don’t mix. Fats require special handling.</p>
		<p>In fat breakdown, above, you can see how bile salts help break fats from food into small droplets, giving them a greater surface area so that digestive enzymes can break them apart. In fat absorption, you can see how fats are packaged into chylomicrons and transported through the lymphatic system to the bloodstream.</p>
		<p>This theme of wrapping fats in coated packages continues. Once they’re nearly empty, chylomicrons are taken up by the liver. Their remaining cargo is combined with fats that are made in the liver along with other lipids (including cholesterol) and packaged into VLDLs, or very low-density lipoproteins. VLDLs travel to all the tissues of the body, delivering their cargo where it is needed. As fats are removed, VLDLs shrink, and they become more dense (remember, fat floats on water). They soon become LDLs, or low-density lipoproteins. Eventually, when most of their fat is gone and they contain mainly cholesterol, they become HDLs, or high-density lipoproteins, which return to the liver.</p>
		<h3>Good and bad cholesterol</h3>
		<p>You may have heard of LDLs and HDLs in the context of cholesterol. LDLs are often called “bad cholesterol” and HDLs are often called “good cholesterol.” What’s important to remember is that low-density and high-density lipoproteins are packages that carry cholesterol and other lipids, not the cholesterol itself. Cholesterol is cholesterol, and all of our cells need it. </p>
		<p>What's different is the characteristics of the packages. LDLs are out to deliver their contents, including cholesterol, to the tissue of the body. When LDL levels are high, they can get stuck on the walls of blood vessels, forming "plaques." This build-up can reduce blood flow, leading to heart attack or stroke. HDLs, on the other hand, are picking up cargo, including cholesterol, from the rest of the body and bringing it to the liver.</p>
		<p>HDLs are considered "good" for a few reasons. First, some evidence suggests they can pick up cholesterol deposits from blood vessel walls, decreasing plaque build-up. Second, HDLs take cholesterol out of circulation. When they return to the liver, their cholesterol is converted into bile. Bile is dumped into the digestive tract, and some of it leaves in our feces—the only way we have of getting rid of cholesterol for good.</p>
