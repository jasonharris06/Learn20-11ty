		<p>In addition to the nutrients described above, our food contains "micronutrients"â€”vitamins and minerals that our bodies need to stay healthy. The digestive system absorbs these micronutrients, sending them to the bloodstream where they can travel to all of our cells.</p>

		<p>Water-soluble micronutrients, such as vitamins B and C, dissolve easily in the watery contents of our digestive tract. The cells that line the gut take up these nutrients and transport them to the bloodstream.</p>

		<p>Fat-soluble micronutrients, such as vitamins A and D, do not dissolve in water. Instead, they hitch a ride with fats, traveling in chylomicrons and VLDLs as described above. Eating a little fat with our food makes it possible to absorb these vitamins.</p>

<p>Some vitamins, such as K and B12, are made by microbes that live in the large intestine. They travel through the cells that line the large intestine and out to the rest of the body. </p>
