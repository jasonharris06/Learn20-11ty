    <div style="display:none" aria-hidden=true>

        <div>You fall and sprain your ankle.</div>
        <div>It hurts, so you don’t want to walk on it.
</div>
        <div>As you wait for a ride, you wonder...</div>
        <div></div>
        <div>are one example of a pain medication.</div>
        <div>They work just like your body’s endorphins, blocking pain messages from getting to the brain.</div>
        <div>Pain is protection.
</div>
        <div>It’s like a built-in alarm system that tells us when a
behavior is harmful, or when something’s wrong
inside our body.
</div>
        <div>Protective pain is also called acute pain.
</div>
        <div>It starts from a specific cause and goes away when
the cause is gone and the injury heals.
</div>
        <div>Pain signals travel along pain pathways in the body.
</div>
        <div>Danger-detecting sensory neurons start the pain message.</div>
        <div>The sensory neurons connect
to neurons in the spinal cord.
</div>
        <div>The signal is relayed up through
the spinal cord, to the brain.
</div>
        <div>This upward pathway is called</div>
        <div>Once the ascending message reaches the brain, it’s translated and we feel pain.</div>
        <div>But pain is a complex experience.
</div>
        <div>Many inputs come together to determine what we feel.
</div>
        <div>Our pain pathways are set up to allow a different
response in certain situations.
</div>
        <div>You may need to escape a dangerous situation,
despite pain from an injury.
</div>
        <div>When a woman gives birth, she has to persevere even
though it’s painful.
</div>
        <div>When pain isn’t useful, our bodies
produce their own painkillers.
</div>
        <div>They’re natural opioids called</div>
        <div>Endorphins stop pain signals
as they travel to the brain.
</div>
        <div>Endorphins have different effects in
many places throughout the body.
</div>
        <div>In the spinal cord,
</div>
        <div>Endorphins directly block pain
signals in the ascending pathway.
</div>
        <div>Pain messages don’t get to the brain.</div>
        <div>Normally, there are signals that prevent activity in the descending pathway.</div>
        <div>Endorphins block these signals.
</div>
        <div>The descending pathway becomes more active, and puts the brakes on the ascending pathway more strongly.</div>
        <div>Fewer pain messages reach the brain.</div>
        <div>Sometimes our natural painkillers aren’t enough,
and we use medications to stop pain.
</div>
        <div>This is especially the case for very severe or long-lasting
pain that no longer serves a protective purpose.
</div>
        <div>But the effects of opioids</div>
        <div>Endorphins are quickly inactivated,
while opioid drugs last longer.
</div>
        <div>And while at least some endorphins are made</div>
        <div>Endorphins do affect processes outside of pain
management (like mood and reward).
</div>
        <div>But opioid drugs have many more side effects.
</div>
        <div>Some, like effects on breathing, can be quite dangerous.
</div>
        <div>Opioids are just one of many
medications used for treating pain.
</div>
        <div>Each works in a different part of the pain pathway, and
each has its own way of stopping pain signals.
</div>
        <div>That’s why some painkillers work better for
different people, or for different types of pain.
</div>
        <div>NSAIDs (like aspirin or ibuprofen) work by preventing
cells from producing compounds (called prostaglandins)
that promote pain signals at nerve endings.
</div>
        <div>Local anesthetics (like lidocaine) temporarily block
sensation of all nerve fibers (pain and others) in the
area in which they’re applied.
</div>
        <div>Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is believed to prevent
production of prostaglandins in some tissues.
</div>
        <div>Prostaglandins are compounds that
promote pain signals at nerve endings.
</div>
        <div>Acetaminophen may also work to block pain
signals directly in several places of the brain.
</div>
        <div>Imagine you’re skateboarding.</div>
        <div>START</div>
        <div>What would life be like without pain?</div>
        <div>Or when something's wrong inside our body</div>
        <div>Protective pain is also called</div>
        <div>It starts from a specific cause and goes away when the cause is gone and the injury heals.</div>
        <div>It's like a built in alarm system that tells us when a behavior is harmful</div>
        <div>Thalamus (relay station)
</div>
        <div>Amygdala
(emotional perception)
</div>
        <div>This is especially the case for very severe
</div>
        <div>Sensory areas of the brain process
information about the injury itself.
</div>
        <div>Other areas process emotional information, like a person’s past experiences, plus their current setting and mood.</div>
        <div>Emotions influence how “unpleasant” pain is and how much attention it’s given.</div>
        <div>Athletes often don’t notice bumped elbows or scraped
knees until the heat of competition is past.
</div>
        <div>Our pain pathways are set up to allow a different response in certain situations.</div>
        <div>or long-lasting pain that no longer serves a protective purpose.
</div>
        <div>are stronger than those of endorphins.</div>
        <div>and released only where they’re needed,</div>
        <div>opioid drugs act across most of the body.
</div>
        <div>After interpreting the pain message,
our brain directs signals back downward.
</div>
        <div>One downward signal connects to muscles.
</div>
        <div>It causes a protective reaction.
</div>
        <div>The other downward signal travels along</div>
        <div>Its job is to slow or stop the original ascending
pain message before it gets to the brain.
</div>
        <div>The descending pain pathway connects to the
ascending pathway in the spinal cord.
</div>
        <div>It’s like a brake system our brain can use to control
the intensity of what we feel.
</div>
        <div>Pain-sensing neurons are called nociceptors. They respond to extreme temperature, pressure, or chemicals from damaged cells. Nociceptors are found throughout our skin, muscles, bones, and internal organs.
