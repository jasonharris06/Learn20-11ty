    <div>Deep in the brain sits the reward pathway. Its main job is to make us want to repeat the actions that help us survive, and to make it easier to do them again. Things like eating, drinking, friendship, and romance.</div>
    <div>Back</div>
    <div>Through connections to other brain areas, the reward pathway gathers information about what is happening in and around the body; it strengthens brain circuits that control movement and behavior; and it communicates with brain regions that make and retrieve memories.</div>
    <div>3/10</div>
    <div>Imagine you haven’t eaten all day, and someone gives you a nice big sandwich. Your senses take in the information and send messages to the brain.</div>
    <div>4/10</div>
    <div>5/10</div>
    <div>Stored in another part of your brain is the memory that when you eat a sandwich, you will no longer be hungry, and you will feel good. Based on this information, the brain tells the body to pick up the sandwich and eat it.

</div>
    <div>Your senses let the brain know that the body is eating some tasty food and the stomach is filling up. Then neurons in the reward pathway release the chemical dopamine. Other brain chemicals are also released, giving you a little jolt of pleasure. That’s your reward for eating the sandwich.

</div>
    <div>6/10</div>
    <div>When the reward pathway releases dopamine, signals travel to other brain regions.

</div>
    <div>7/10</div>
    <div>Through signals to memory regions, the reward pathway helps to build the memory that eating this food is good, plus details about where and how you got the sandwich. This makes it more likely that you will do it again.

</div>
    <div>8/10</div>
    <div>Through signals to the brain’s motor center, it strengthens brain circuits that help you achieve your reward. In this case, it makes it easier for you to seek out a sandwich, pick it up, and eat it. With enough repetition, these actions become habits.

</div>
    <div>9/10</div>
    <div>Start Over</div>
    <div>Through little jolts of dopamine, the reward pathway motivates us to repeat behaviors that are necessary for survival.

    <div>The brain may look like a squishy blob. Yet clusters of neurons form distinct regions have specific jobs. These brain regions connect with one another in a highly organized way.</div>
