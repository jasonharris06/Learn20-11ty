		<div>HOMEOSTASIS</div>
		<div>During homeostasis, Elaine’s brain is in balance. It’s tuned to interpret and respond to the stimuli she encounters every day. Small adjustments to her changing environment keep messages flowing as they should.</div>
		<div>RETURN</div>
		<div>OF</div>
		<div>OPIOIDS</div>
		<div>TOLERANCE</div>
		<div>AND THE</div>
		<div>PHYSIOLOGY</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Pain Pathway</div>
		<div>Pain signals fire more often
</div>
		<div>Sometimes people with tolerance compensate by using a higher dose of the drug. But their nervous system continues changing to offset the drug’s effects. Their tolerance increases even more. During long-term medical use, a doctor might increase a patient’s dose to 10 times what it originally was.</div>
		<div>Elaine’s leg hurts a lot while it heals. Her doctor gives her an opioid prescription. It works well at first.</div>
		<div>People using opioids illegally sometimes take doses that are 100’s of times higher.</div>
		<div>Opioids interact with many different types of neurons to influence multiple functions. Opioids affect each type of neuron a little differently. And tolerance builds at different rates too.</div>
		<div>Tolerance to build relief and reward pathway stimulation builds quickly. But opioids also slow breathing, and tolerance to this effect builds slowly. Over time, the dose needed to relieve pain or cause pleasure gets closer to a lethal dose — one that stops a person from breathing.</div>
		<div>Opioids become ineffective
</div>
		<div>Decrease Pain
Increase Reward
</div>
		<div>But after a just a few doses, Elaine’s pain starts to return. Regular use of the drug is re-tuning her neurons. They change to turn a large response into a more appropriate one. (It’s a little like how your eyes adjust when you walk from a dark room into bright sunlight.)</div>
		<div>Slow Breathing
</div>
		<div>Many opioid receptors remain desensitized. Elaine finds she no longer gets pain relief from her usual opioid dose. This is the beginning of tolerance.</div>
		<div>Decrease Pain
</div>
		<div>The longer Elaine takes opioids, the more her nervous system changes. In her pain pathway, neurons shift to a state where it’s much easier for them to fire an action potential, sending the message that she’s in pain. And the message now gets through, even when opioids are in there to block it.</div>
		<div>Increase Constipation
</div>
		<div>1ST OPIOID USE</div>
		<div>When the drug Elaine took wears off, her brain recovers its balance. Sensitive receptors return, and her neurons are again tuned to respond to natural opioids.
</div>
		<div>Since her brain is tuned to be sensitive to the comparatively smaller dose of natural opioids, the effect of the drug is strong. Many sensitive receptors are available for the drug to bind, and the pain message is almost completely blocked. Elaine’s leg no longer hurts at all.
</div>
		<div>Reward Pathway
</div>
		<div>In the emergency room, Elaine is given an opioid painkiller. Opioids flood the synapse.</div>
		<div>Meanwhile, in a different pathway called the Reward Pathway, Elaine’s experience with opioids is recorded. Stopping pain with a pill is rewarding and something she may want to repeat in the future.
</div>
		<div>Taking the drug creates a large imbalance in Elaine’s brain. The drug is active for much longer compared to her natural opioids. Many more receptors become temporarily desensitized.
</div>
		<div>1-2 WEEKS</div>
		<div>1 MONTH+</div>
		<div>Soon Elaine’s brain begins to rebalance again, this time by reversing the changes that cause tolerance. Some changes reverse very quickly. For example, sensitive opioid receptors can return to neuron membranes within hours. Other changes take longer.</div>
		<div>Over time, drug use also causes changes in the brain that are separate from the ones that cause tolerance. These changes affect the parts of the brain responsible for judgement, decision-making, learning, and memory. They influence a person’s chance for addiction and can last months or even years.</div>
		<div>72 HOURS</div>
		<div>WITHDRAWAL</div>
		<div>When Elaine’s leg heals, she stops taking opioids. But her neurons are adapted to a new normal that includes the drug. Without the drug, they’re off balance. Within hours of stopping use, Elaine feels the very unpleasant physical and emotional symptoms of withdrawal.</div>
		<div>People who suffer from opioid addiction often go through multiple rounds of stopping and restarting. If a person restarts with the same dose they were used to when their tolerance was high, the effect of the drug is much greater. The results can be deadly.</div>
		<div>RESTARTING</div>
		<div>Pain Receptor</div>
		<div>Opioid Receptor</div>
		<div>Neurotransmitter</div>
		<div>Opioid</div>
		<div>To make the pain more bearable, Elaine’s body produces natural opioids called endorphins. The endorphins bind opioid receptors on the neurons in Elaine’s pain pathway. The pain message is dulled, and Elain’s broken leg hurts a little less.</div>
		<div>Activation of opioid receptors causes them to become desensitized. They can no longer communicate with the inside of the cell. Some even leave the membrane, and are either broken down or reactivated. It’s a delicate balance.</div>
		<div>Receptor availability plus other changes keep Elaine’s neurons tuned to respond to her body’s natural painkilling signals. Soon after they’ve done their job, Elaine’s natural opioids are deactivated. Homeostasis is quickly restored. The neurons’s membrane contains many sensitive receptors once again.
</div>
		<div>NATIVE OPIOIDS</div>
		<div>One day Elaine falls and breaks her leg. Neurons in her pain pathway send a message. It moves from one neuron to the next across synapses. Finally the message reaches her brain, and is interpreted. “This hurts!"</div>
