TWINS
</div>
		<div>One way scientists estimate the effect of genes compared to the environment on traits is by studying twins.</div>
		<div>IDENTICAL GENES
</div>
		<div>IDENTICAL TWINS
</div>
		<div>50% SAME GENES
</div>
		<div>Identical twins have identical genes, while fraternal twins share half their genes, just like any other siblings. All twins have differences in their environments.</div>
		<div>It’s rare, but a handful of traits are primarily influenced by a single gene. Single-gene traits include freckles, red-green color blindness, and sickle cell disease.</div>
		<div>A change in the HHB gene causes sickle cell disease</div>

		<div>Because children inherit a copy of the gene from each parent, there is a very high chance single-gene traits are shared among close family members.</div>

</div>
		<div>Unlike single-gene traits, those influenced by multiple genes are harder to place into distinct categories. They often exist along a continuum.</div>
		<div>Beyond studying twins, scientists can use larger family groups to find the cause of a trait.</div>
		<div>When close relatives resemble each other more than they resemble non relatives, this suggests a genetic cause.</div>

</div>
		<div>Once scientists understand a trait’s inheritance, they can search for the causative gene or genes.</div>
		<div>First, they collect DNA from many people with differenct versions of the trait. They look for regions of the DNA sequence that are the same within a group, but different between groups.</div>
		<div>Brown Eyes
</div>
		<div>Scientists use very large sample sizes and statistical analysis to show certain gene variations, or combinations of variations, are usually present in people with a particular trait.</div>
		<div>Multi-gene traits are more challenging to test, but it’s still possible.</div>
		<div>Often, the function of the gene, and the protein it codes for, can be studied and confirmed in the lab with cells or model organisms.</div>

</div>
		<div>That’s because each person has a mix of variations in many genes that add together to influence their version of the trait.</div>

		<div>But researchers get creative, look for new patterns, and identify multiple pieces of evidence that support the same conclusion.
</div>
		<div>The cause of a trait is rarely simple, and often the clues are complex.
</div>
		<div>This helps to tell the most complete story about the many factors that can come together to cause a trait.
</div>
		<div>Height Genes
</div>
		<div>Skin Color Genes
</div>
		<div>Most inherited traits require the combined function of many genes (and the proteins they code for).</div>
		<div>Hair Color Genes
</div>
		<div>It’s a lot like solving any other mystery — researchers identify patterns and clues to find the answer.</div>
		<div>Environment
</div>
		<div>YOU!
</div>
		<div>But how do they find out how much each factor affects a trait?</div>
		<div>Scientists tell us genes and the environment shape our traits, often working together in complex and surprising ways.</div>
		<div>Genes</div>
		<div>Relatives may participate in similar activities, exercise, and routines.
</div>
		<div>Researchers must be careful not to conclude a trait is inherited just because relatives share it. In addition to sharing genes, families often share environments.</div>
		<div>Location and type of housing can contribute to shared familial traits.
</div>
		<div>Traits due to pollution can be the same between relatives due to proximity in housing.
</div>
		<div>Families typically share similar diets and eating habits.
</div>
		<div>Shared exposure to toxins, diet, and social traditions can contribute to a family’s shared traits.
</div>
		<div>NO FRECKLES
</div>
		<div>A big clue a trait may be controlled by a single gene is if it falls into a clear, distinct category. For instance, you either have freckles or you don’t.</div>
