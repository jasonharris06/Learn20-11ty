		<div>Genetic factors: Hundreds of genetic variations contribute to complex diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and others. Usually, each variation has a small effect that either increases or decreases a person’s overall risk of becoming sick.</div>
		<div>Complex diseases </div>
		<div>If diabetes runs in your family, you can decrease your risk by eating healthy. On the other hand, a person without a family history of diabetes may be at risk due to a diet high in fat and sugar.</div>
		<div>Environmental Factors</div>
		<div>Nutrition</div>
		<div>Stress</div>
		<div>Stress by itself can impact a person’s disease risk, but it can also affect other environmental factors. For example, people often have less time ot cook meals or exercise during stressful times.</div>
		<div>Regular exercise decreases a person’s risk for may complex diseases.</div>
		<div>Exercise</div>
		<div>There are endless combinations of environmental factors that increase your risk or protect you from complex disease. Many come from a wide variety of social influences. People with a strong community tend to heave less stress. Your culture influences your traditions, the foods you eat, and how you spend your free time.</div>
		<div>Family/culture/peers</div>
		<div>Children grow very quickly until their mid to late teens. Having a serious health problem early in life can have a big impact on height.</div>
		<div>Disease</div>
		<div>The food you eat plays a role in how tall you will become. As you age, nutrition impacts your risk for conditions that may decrease your height, like osteoporosis.</div>
		<div>Genetic factors: Individuals inherit the potential to be a certain height from their parents. Height involves hundreds of genetic variations, most with small effect.</div>
		<div>Hormones</div>
		<div>To build muscle, we must eat enough food, including a balance of proteins. Without proper nutrition, we can’t grow strong muscles.</div>
		<div>Genetic factors: Even in healthy people, strength can be different due to genetic variation. Small differences in the organization of muscle fibers and how muscles communicate with the nervous system affect each person’s capacity for strength.</div>
		<div>How strong you are can depend a lot on your lifestyle and regular activities. Playing sports, lifting weights, and many other actives build muscle.</div>
		<div>Some athletes use anabolic steroids to increase muscle mass, usually unethically. These synthetic hormones mimic male sex hormones. But they influence many other traits as well, including mood and behavior.</div>
		<div>Genetic factors: The genetics of hair loss are complex, but one gene that is often involved codes for a protein called the androgen receptor. It helps cells detect hormones like testoterone.</div>
		<div>A woman usually has low levels of testosterone, which protects her from hair loss. But what if her environment changes? If a woman becomes stressed, she’ll produce more testosterone and might begin to lose hair.</div>
		<div>Have you ever wondered why baldness is a trait more often associated with men? Hormones like testosterone are typically higher in men, and they influence hair loss.</div>
		<div>Genetic factors: Your genes have little to do with your personal tastes. These come almost entirely from environmental factors.</div>
		<div>Personal tastes
</div>
		<div>You likely have preferences in art or music, and activities you enjoy like reading, watching TV, or playing video games. These tastes often reflect interests introduced to you by your family, friends, and community.</div>
		<div>Language
</div>
		<div>Developmental environment</div>
		<div>Family/culture/peers
</div>
		<div>Genetic factors: Many different genes give you the framework to learn and use language. They affect things like brain function and muscle control.</div>
		<div>Language is a trait that is particularly subject to influence during certain stages of life. Even as we learn to speak one language, we start to lose the ability to make sounds that are used in other languages. Adults tend to be slower than children to pick up a new language. And for most of us, it’s very hard to speak a new language accent-free if we learn it after puberty.</div>
		<div>Babies are born with the potential to learn any language. Which specific language(s) they learn is completely determined by what’s spoken around them.</div>
		<div>The attitudes and behaviors of a person’s friends and family toward smoking, for example, can play a large part in whether he or she will develop an addiction.</div>
		<div>Genetic factors: Many genes affect how a person’s brain works, influencing their susceptibility to addiction.</div>
		<div>Addiction
</div>
		<div>Asthma
</div>
		<div>For some people, strenuous exercise can cause asthma symptoms.</div>
		<div>Genetic factors: It’s estimated that about half a person’s risk for asthma comes from variation in genes, while the other half is from the environment.</div>
		<div>Air Quality</div>
		<div>It’s important to remember environmental factors don’t always have a negative effect. In the case of asthma, living in a rural area, having a childhood pet, or growing up in a large family may actually help. Growing up in these scenarios exposes people to a wide variety of microbial organisms, which helps them build a resistance to asthma. Scientists are still working to understand the details of how this works.</div>
		<div>Developmental environment
</div>
		<div>Often people don’t experience asthma symptoms until they encounter pollution or allergens. Even something like baking flour that seems harmless can sometimes trigger asthma.
</div>
		<div>Sun exposure</div>
		<div>Genetic factors: Variations in a handful of genes can influence your risk for skin cancer. One example is a version of the gene MC1R, which gives people red hair and fair skin.</div>
		<div>At high elevations, the atmosphere provides less protection from the sun. Because of this, people who live at high altitudes have a greater risk for skin cancer.</div>
		<div>Repeated sun exposure increases a person’s risk for skin cancer, because the sun can damage DNA in skin cells.</div>
		<div>Community/region</div>
		<div>Skin cancer
</div>
		<div>Vitamin D levels</div>
		<div>People living near the poles experience less direct sunlight, so they’re more likely to be deficient in vitamin D. In places with seasons, people are at a higher risk or vitamin D deficiency in the winter than in the summer.</div>
		<div>While vitamin D is often called the sunshine vitamin, you can get it from your diet as well. Eating fish, drinking fortified milk and orange juice, or taking a supplement can help you meet recommended levels.</div>
		<div>Spending some time in the sun can be good for you. It causes you to produce vitamin D, which is important for the health of your bones and immune system.</div>
		<div>Genetic factors: Certain genes (and the proteins they code for) are needed to convert vitamin D into an active form your body can use, and to transport it to where it’s needed. Variations in these genes can cause people to have more or less available vitamin D.</div>
		<div>The nutrients available determine if yeast cells will undergo sexual or asexual reproduction.</div>
		<div>Genetic factors: Just like human traits, the traits of tiny yeast cells can involve several genes and the proteins they code for.</div>
		<div>Yeast reproduction
</div>
		<div>Nutrition
</div>
		<div>Imagine you have two corn plants with identical genetic material, but plant one in nutrient-rich soil and one in sand. Even though the two plants have the same genetics, their traits are likely to be very different.</div>
		<div>The amount of sunlight a plant gets has a huge impact on its growth. With too little light, plants become pale and spindly. With too much, they can become stunted and sun damaged, and even die. For some plants, changes in the number of daylight hours causes them to grow flowers or go dormant.</div>
		<div>Genetic factors: Many genes work together during plant growth. These genes code for proteins that build tissue, control plant growth hormones, and carry out other important jobs.</div>
		<div>Plant growth
</div>
		<div>Rat behavior
</div>
		<div>Genetic Factors: Dozens of genes control brain development and influence behavior.</div>
		<div>Rats raised in complex enclosures usually do better in mazes compared to rats raised in simple environments.</div>
		<div>Stress by itself can impact a person’s disease risk, but it can also affect other environmental factors. For example, people often have less time to cook meals or exercise during stressful times.</div>
