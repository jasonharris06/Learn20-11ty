<p class="parhead">What is CML (chronic myelogenous leukemia)?	</p>

<p>Cells normally grow and divide only when they are needed to keep our bodies functioning properly.  But sometimes, 
the mechanisms that regulate cell growth stop working and cells divide out of control.  This is called cancer.  
Leukemia is one type of cancer.  With leukemia, white blood cells called leukocytes grow out of control.  
Like other blood cells, leukocytes are made in the bone marrow.  Normally, mature leukocytes are released into the 
bloodstream, where they work to fight off infections in our bodies.  Cancerous leukocytes cannot fight off infection, 
and they interfere with the functions of other organs.</p>

<p>CML is caused by a chromosomal abnormality in which a segment from chromosome 9 switches places with a segment of 
chromosome 22 (called a translocation).  Chromosome 9 becomes longer than normal, and chromosome 22 is shortened. </p> 

<p>This translocation interrupts the genes ABL and BCR from chromosomes 9 and 22, respectively.  As a result, an abnormal 
fusion of the two genes (BCR-ABL) occurs on chromosome 22.  The BCR-ABL gene fusion leads to the production of an 
abnormally long protein.  This protein is more active than usual and therefore triggers the overproduction of white 
blood cells. The new chromosome 22 containing the BCR-ABL gene fusion has been named the Philadelphia chromosome.</p>

<p class="parhead">How do people get CML?</p>

<p>Sometimes a person inherits DNA mutations from a parent that greatly increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer.  
But inherited mutations are very rarely the cause of chronic myeloid leukemia.  Rather, the translocation that causes 
CML usually occurs after birth.  Moreover, the Philadelphia chromosome is not present in all of a patient's cells, 
just the cancerous leukocytes.  </p>

<p class="parhead">What are the symptoms of CML?</p>

<p>During the chronic phase of the disease, which can last for many years, people with the disease will not have symptoms. 
But eventually, the disease progresses to the accelerated phase as white blood cells multiply.  Symptoms during this 
phase include: fever, weakness, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, bone pain, bleeding or bruising, and pressure under 
the ribs from an enlarged spleen.</p>

<p class="parhead">How do doctors diagnose CML?</p>

<p>A CBC (complete blood count) is one of the most common tests for CML.  This test examines a sample of the patient's blood 
under a microscope to look for unusually high numbers of white blood cells.</p>

<p>If the patient's white blood cell count is high, the diagnosis can be confirmed with a karyotype to look for the Philadelphia chromosome.</p>

<p class="parhead">How is CML treated?</p>

<p>The goals of CML treatment are to reduce the number of white blood cells and put the patient into a symptom-free state 
known as remission.  Treatments include:</p>

<p>.	Chemotherapy (drugs) and radiation (high doses of x-rays) are used to kill cancer cells.  However, they also kill all 
other rapidly dividing cells in the body, including hair cells and the cells that line the digestive tract.  This is why 
people who go through these treatments lose their hair and are often very sick to their stomach.   </p>

<p>.	A bone marrow transplant in which the patient's bone marrow stem cells are replaced with those from a healthy, 
matching donor.  To do this, all of the patient's existing bone marrow and abnormal leukocytes are first killed using 
a combination of chemotherapy and radiation.  Next, a sample of donor bone marrow containing healthy stem cells is 
introduced into the patient's bloodstream.  If the transplant is successful, the stem cells will migrate into the 
patient's bone marrow and begin producing new, healthy leukocytes to replace the abnormal cells.</p>

<p class="parhead">Interesting facts about CML</p>

<p>The Philadelphia chromosome was first discovered in the city for which it is named.  It was the first cancer-causing 
chromosomal abnormality to be identified.</p>

<p>About 5,000 new cases of CML are diagnosed in the United States each year.</p>
