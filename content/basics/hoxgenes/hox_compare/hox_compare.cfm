<h3>Homeotic Gene Organization Is Conserved Through Evolution</h3>

	<p>The extent to which gene sequence and 
	organization are conserved between organisms gives us clues about the amount of 
	evolutionary time that has passed since the two organisms diverged from one another. 
	For example, the homeotic gene clusters in the flour beetle (<em>Tribolium</em>) and 
	the fruit fly (<em>Drosophila</em>) are very similar. In contrast, the homeotic gene 
	clusters in these two insects differ greatly from those in the mouse. The presence of 
	homeotic gene sequences in animals as different as insects and mammals suggests that 
	this type of gene has a crucial function in many, and perhaps all, animals.</p>

	<p>This figure shows the organization of homeotic gene clusters in the flour beetle, 
	the fruit fly and the mouse. The colored boxes represent different homeotic genes as 
	they are laid out on a chromosome (signified by the blue line).</p>

	<p>The squiggle in the middle of the Drosophila chromosome represents the space on the 
	chromosome between the two homeotic gene clusters, ANT-C and BX-C. Each of the four 
	homeotic gene clusters in the mouse (inside the pink box) resides on a different chromosome.</p>

	<h5>The mouse, fruit fly and flour beetle have similar homeobox genes. What can gene 
	organization tell us about evolutionary relationships between these organisms?</h5>

	<h4>Flour Beetle</h4>

	<p>One way scientists study this type of problem is to compare the chromosomal arrangement of 
	homologous genes in different organisms. The homeotic genes of the flour beetles cluster 
	tightly on one chromosome - scientists refer to this clustering as tight linkage. Genes that 
	are closer together on a chromosome are more likely to be inherited by the next 
	generation as a linked group. </p>

	<h4>Fruit Fly</h4>
	
	<p>Homeotic genes in the fruit fly are broken into two clusters on the same chromosome and separated 
	by a long stretch of DNA (blue line). The five genes shown at left (blue and pink boxes) 
	represent the Antennapedia complex (ANT-C). The three genes shown at right (yellow boxes) are part 
	of the Bithorax complex (BX-C).</p>

	<h4>Mouse</h4>
	
	<p>The mouse has four homeotic gene clusters. All four are similar, but they are located on different 
	chromosomes. Scientists believe that this sort of gene arrangement results from the duplication of a 
	chromosomal region. The homeotic gene cluster in mammals has apparently been duplicated four times. 
	Each cluster is somewhat different. Most are incomplete, missing some fraction of the genes that are 
	present in the ancestral gene cluster.</p>
