<h3>How Did Scientists Discover the Genes That Determine Body Pattern?</h3>

	<p>Scientists discovered these genes by 
	studying bizarre mutations in fruit flies. They 
	correlated mutations in different genes with transformations in the flies' body patterns. 
	These types of mutations, called homeotic mutations, cause structures in one body segment 
	to be replaced by structures normally found in another segment.</p>
	
	<h5>One example of a homeotic transformation in fruit flies - antenna to leg</h5>
	
	
	<p>One research group, led by biologist Ed Lewis, studied fruit flies that had legs growing 
	out of their heads in place of antennae! They found that a mutation in a single gene, called 
	<em>Antennapedia</em>, made this transformation happen. Scientists believe that this mutation 
	changes not only the antennal structure, but makes that entire segment of the fruit fly's body 
	develop as if it were a different segment.</p>
	
	
	<p>Dr. Lewis's work demonstrated that antennal cells carry all of the information necessary to 
	become leg cells. This is a general principle: every cell in an organism carries, within its 
	DNA, all of the information necessary to build the entire organism.</p>

	<h5>Genes that determine body pattern have common sequence characteristics</h5>
	
	<p>While studying the DNA sequences of many genes that control body pattern, researchers 
	found that each contains a similar stretch of about 180 nucleotides within its sequence. 
	They named this stretch a homeobox, and classified all genes containing it as homeotic genes. 
	The homeobox is only a portion of each gene. For example, if the words below were homeotic 
	genes, the capital letters would represent the homeobox:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>toge<span style="color: #CC0000;">THE</span>r</li>
		<li><span style="color: #CC0000;">THE</span>oretical</li>
	 	<li>ga<span style="color: #CC0000;">THE</span>ring</li>
	 	<li>bo<span style="color: #CC0000;">THE</span>r</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Shown below is the homeotic gene expression seen in the fruit fly. As you 
	mouse over the different genes in the homeotic complexes, you can observe that each gene is 
	responsible for controlling body pattern in a particular region. Also notice that the genes 
	are arranged on the chromosome in an order corresponding to the order they appear on the body.</p>
