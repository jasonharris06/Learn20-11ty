<h3>Many Organisms Have Similar Sets of Homeotic Genes</h3>

<p>Researchers were curious to know whether organisms other than fruit flies also had 
homeotic genes that regulated body patterning. Several research groups, led by Bill 
McGinnis, Michael Levine and Walter Gehring, examined this question.
</p>

<p>First, they looked through the DNA from a variety of animals for sequences similar 
to the homeobox. They took advantage of the fact that DNA is double stranded, meaning 
that DNA is composed of two separable strands, connected by A-T and C-G base pairs.
</p>

<h5>How did they do this?</h5>

<p>The two strands in DNA can be melted apart at high temperatures. Once separated, the 
strands are free to pair with other DNA molecules in the same mixture. If the two 
original strands are the only molecules in the mixture, then they will re-pair with 
each other, reforming the original double-stranded DNA molecule. If other DNA molecules 
with similar sequences are present in the mixture, then new double-stranded DNA molecules 
will be formed using different combinations of single strands.</p>

<p>To see whether other animals contain homeobox sequences in their DNA, the researchers 
mixed fruit fly homeobox DNA sequences with DNA from other animals, such as frogs. They 
heated the mixture to separate the DNA strands, then allowed the mixture to cool slowly. 
The slow cooling process allows DNA molecules with complementary sequences to find each 
other and pair together. Then they observed whether double stranded DNA sequences had formed 
between the fruit fly and frog DNA. Finally, they isolated the frog sequences that had base 
paired with the fruit fly homeobox DNA and determined the frog DNA sequence.</p>

<h5>What did they find?</h5> 

<p>Every animal tested had homeobox sequences in its DNA.</p>

<p>Homeobox sequences found in most mammalian genes are very similar to those in fruit 
flies. These sequences have been conserved throughout evolution without much change.</p>

<p>Gene sequences maintained over evolutionary time are thought to be especially important 
to the basic development of even distantly related organisms. For example, flour beetles and 
fruit flies share a cluster of homeobox genes, called the homeotic complex or HOM-C, that are 
very similar in sequence and function.</p>

<p>Genes in different organisms that share similar sequence and function are called homologous. 
The insect HOM-C gene cluster also shares homology with Hox gene complexes in mammals.</p>
