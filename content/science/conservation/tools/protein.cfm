<h3>Protein Electrophoresis</h3>

<p>To compare proteins from two different types of plants,
scientists sometimes carry out an experiment to separate the
proteins from each other, so they can be examined separately (a
protein electrophoresis experiment). A mixture of protein molecules
is extracted from plant tissue and placed at one end of a slab of
gelatin-like material. The gel slab is then placed in a strong electrical
field. <img src="images/proteingel.gif" width="159" height="289" alt="gels" style="float: right; padding-top: 20px; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" /> 
All of the proteins are pulled
toward the positive pole of the electric field (+ in each of the
three gel pictures), but because big molecules travel slowly
through the gel matrix and small molecules travel more quickly, the
proteins become separated according to their size. Molecules can
also be separated on the basis of charge or pH.</p>

<p>The banding pattern that forms in an experiment like this is
distinctive for each set of proteins studied. In fact, comparison
of the same protein in different species can show different banding
patterns in the different species. Using this sort of
distinguishing information, scientists can help identify to what
plant species an individual plant belongs.</p>

<p>An electrophoretic study of two "forms" of a fern, <i>Notholaena
candida</i> is shown in the picture. The dark spots in the picture
are proteins extracted from the two types of ferns (labeled CAN and
COP) and separated by protein electrophoresis (different proteins
are identified in 1,2,3). This gel shows that the protein banding
patterns of the two types of ferns are different from each other.
Along with other sorts of evidence, this experiment suggests that
the two ferns are different enough from each other that perhaps
they should be recognized as different species of fern.</p>

<p>Why would the banding patterns of the same protein (a protein
with the same function) be different in different species? Over
evolutionary time, the DNA of the two species accumulates
differences due to mutation. The proteins in the two types of
organisms (which are encoded by the DNA) may have slightly
different sequences, which accounts for different banding patterns
on the gels, but still retain the same or similar functions.</p>
