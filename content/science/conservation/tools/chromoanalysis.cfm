<h3>Chromosome Analysis </h3>
</div>
<table>

<td valign="top" class="stdcol">

Comparing the DNA of
different organisms can show how closely related they are. 
Since for each species the DNA 
information is organized in a characteristic number of  
chromosomes, 
the number of chromosomes is a reasonable
indicator of the relatedness of two simliar species. 

<p>Sometimes the DNA information on a chromosome is reorganized.
Chromosomes can sometimes fuse with each other or can exchange
chromosome "arms". When this happens, DNA information is not always
lost, but it can become mixed up. This sort of rearrangement may not
cause problems for the individual who carries the change --- as
long as all the DNA is still present. </p>

<p>A mule is the product of two different species (a horse and a
donkey) mating with each other. The fact that these two different
types of animals can mate and produce viable offspring tells
scientists that horses and donkeys are closely related. However,
mules are always sterile. Why is this? Horses and donkeys have different
chromosome numbers (see below). The fact that horses and donkeys
have different chromosome numbers tells scientists that these two
are different species.</p>

<p>For the mule, having parents with different
chromosome numbers isn't a problem. During mitotic <a
href="javascript:glossary('cell');">cell</a> division,
each of the chromosomes copies itself and then distributes these
two copies to the two daughter cells. In contrast, when the mule is
producing sperm or egg cells during meiosis, each pair of
chromosomes (one from Mom and one from Dad) need to pair up with
each other. Since the mule doesn't have an even number of
homologous pairs (his parents had different chromosome numbers),
meiosis is disrupted and viable sperm and eggs are not formed.</p>

<h5>Using chromosomes to classify plant species</h5>

</div>
<p>Variations in chromosome number are
even more common in the plant kingdom. In plants, chromosome number
is an important indicator for determining relationships between
plant species. </p>

<p>Scientists at the Utah Museum of Natural History recently used
studies of chromosome number to show that a Utah fern was not the
same species as a very similar fern found in other states. Studies
of the Utah Jones Cloak Fern (originally thought to be
a <em>Notholaena</em> species) showed that the cells of this plant
have 27 chromosomes. Other species of <em>Notholaena</em> found in
other states have 30 chromosomes. When combined with the results of
other studies, the difference in chromosome number helped to prove
that the Utah species actually belonged in the genus <em>
Argyrochosma,</em> a very distant relative of <em>Notholaena .</em></p>

<p>This sort of information is important because it helps
conservation biologists understand the distribution of each
different species of plant. With this sort of information,
scientists are better able to decide which plants are rare and
require protection by means such as the endangered species
list.</p>
